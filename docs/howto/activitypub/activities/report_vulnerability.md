# Reporting a Vulnerability

The following task flow diagram addresses the opening portion of the Report Management process in which a finder
creates a vulnerability report and submits it to a vendor. The vendor then reads the report and either accepts or
rejects it. If the vendor accepts the report, they create a case for it. If the vendor rejects the report, they
eventually close it unless there's a reason to reconsider and validate it.

Report submission might be followed by either a `Read` or `Accept` activity.
The `Read` activity is optional and should be used when the vendor wants to
acknowledge that they have received the report without accepting or rejecting
it. The `Accept` activity is used when the vendor wants to accept the report
and create a case for it.
